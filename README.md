# About Me:
Hi there, I am [Alfredo Cedeno](https://alfredo.cedeno.me) 👋 <br>
I'm a DevSecOps enthusiast with a strong focus on **Cloud Security**, **Infrastructure as Code**, and **Digital Transformation**. I thrive in environments where automation, scalability, and security intersect. <br>

## 🔧 What I'm Working On
- 👨🏻‍💻 Currently serving as a **Cloud Security Engineer**, integrating security into CI/CD pipelines and cloud-native architectures
- 🧪 Building and maintaining a [Homelab Infrastructure](https://github.com/ajcborges/homelab) — a sandbox for testing automation, monitoring, and container orchestration
- 📸 On the creative side, I’m also a [Photographer](https://www.instagram.com/ajcborges) — because good framing matters in both photos and architecture
- 🔍 Open to **collaborations** around DevOps, Cloud, and Security tooling

## 📚 Continuous Learning
- 🌱 Actively exploring new tools in the **Cloud Native** ecosystem (Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, etc.)
- 📝 Sharing insights and tutorials on [alfredo.cedeno.me](https://alfredo.cedeno.me)
- 💬 Always happy to discuss topics like IaC, CI/CD, container security, and cloud governance

## ⚡ Fun Fact
Most of my skills have been **self-taught** — I believe in learning by building, breaking, and rebuilding.

- **Ansible** — configuration management and automation
- **Cloudflare** — edge security and performance optimization
- **Raspberry Pi** — homelab experimentation and edge computing

### 🐳 Containers & OS
- **Docker** — containerization for microservices and CI/CD pipelines
- **Linux** — my go-to operating system for servers and scripting
- **Shell Scripting** — automation and system-level task orchestration

### 🔐 DevOps & Security
- **Git** — version control and collaborative workflows
- **Splunk** — log aggregation and security analytics
- **Jira & Confluence** — agile project management and documentation

### 🧠 Programming & Databases
